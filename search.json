    "text": "Mayu Tatsumi is a junior studying Engineering at Harvey Mudd College. She is interested in working in the camera and lighting industries and would like to become involved as an electrical engineer. She has prior experience working as a Systems Control intern specifically working on embedded systems and writing firmware. Outside of engineering, she is interested in movie & TV production, Formula 1, and gaming.\nThis is a Quarto website. To learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."

    "text": "I had a blast this summer working as a Systems Control intern at a company working on some embedded systems for their robot. I mostly worked off what my mentor taught me and what I could soak up from the datasheets and user manuals, so I’m excited to get more formal and grounded education in this field.\nFor this semester, I’m determined to keep myself focused and engaged in class. I’ll write everything on paper since we’re going chalkboard method and keep all my devices in my bag unless I need to. I’ve found out that (surprise!) I actually do learn more via paper and pen, so I’ll try my best to stay locked in and get the most out of this class. I definitely will also review what I’ve learned in E85 since it’s been a while.\nI also want to technically improve my soldering skills and generally working with my hands when it comes to electronics. I had to do a lot of manually soldering and crimping parts together over the summer as well, and I found I had some trouble with it so I want to take this chance as a moment to improve for the future. I’ll have to make some time and take advantage of Mudd’s resources to practice and make perfect."

    "text": "In this lab, the E155 Development Board was constructed for use for the rest of the semester. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) was programmed to take binary input from 4 switches and output patterns using 3 LEDs and a seven-segment display.\nOne of the LEDs was designed to blink at 2.4 Hz by dividing the onboard high-speed oscillator from 24 MHz. The two other LEDs were programmed by applying a XOR and AND gate from inputs from the switches. The seven-segment display was programmed to display distince hexadecimal values between 0 to F given a combination of 4 binary inputs through the same switches."

Utilizing a counterFor the blinking led, the onboard high-speed oscillator, named HSOSC as part of the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library, was used to generate a 24 MHz oscillation acting as a clock signal. Aiming for a 2.4 Hz signal that alternates twice (??), it was necessary to utilize a 24*10^6 Hz / 2.4 Hz / 2 = 5,000,000 counter in the clock divider. Testing for the blinking LED was conducted by an oscilloscope, where one probe was connected to the GND on the FPGA and the other at the () of the diode.\nThe other two LEDs were implemented using a XOR and AND gate following the given truth table.\nThe seven-segment display was programmed by using combinational logic and case statements in the HDL."
